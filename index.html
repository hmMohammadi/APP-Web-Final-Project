                Hardy houseplants are an exceptional choice for apartments that lack the light or space to house plants. 
                Living in such apartments without plants can be a daunting task, and taking care of plants can be a challenge
                 for busy people who spend a lot of time away from home. That's why it's a good idea to learn 
                 about 12 hardy houseplants and learn about how to care for them, such as watering, light, and toxicity in this article.
            </p>
            <p>These plants are not only resilient but also bring a touch of nature indoors, 
                improving air quality and enhancing your living space.
            </p>
            <p>When caring for these plants, it's essential to consider their specific needs. Most hardy houseplants 
                prefer indirect light and can survive with minimal watering, making them ideal for busy lifestyles. 
                It's also crucial to be aware of their toxicity levels, especially if you have pets or young children. Some plants, 
                like the Pothos and Peace Lily, can be mildly toxic if ingested, so it's wise to keep them out of reach.
